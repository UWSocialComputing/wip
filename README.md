**WIP Bot** is a Discord bot that aims to improve the process of finding study partners and study environments, in order to **make studying a more sociable and enjoyable experience** for college students. Students can use WIP Bot to:
- Assign themselves roles that let their classmates know that they are interested in studying at a particular location.
- View information about the noise and busy-ness levels of study locations.

Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/wip-code) to view the code for this project.
